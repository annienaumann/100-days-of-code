# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Days 14 & 15: 10 & 11 June 2017 

**Today's Progress**:  Kept working on Udemy WebDev course focusing on Intro to CSS. Lots learnt and retained, including:

*Colours* - Hexadecimal: eg #FFF800
            RGB: eg rgb(0,255,0) - red, green, blue channells - range is between 0-255)
            RGBA: eg rgba(0,255,0, .6) - same as above but with 'Alpha' - which is transparancy, ranged 0.0-1.0
            
*Borders* - you need to have width, color and style properties or they won't show (or you can put this under the one line (border).

*Strikethrough* - to striketrhoug huse the property 'text-decoration'

3 main selectors are element (p, h1, body), id (#special) - can't be used more than once, and class (.hello) - can be used more than once.

Others:

*Star Selector* - will apply to all elements

*descendent selector* - li a (2 or more selectors, chained together, descentants of a parent element)

*adjacent* - h4 + ul

*attribute selector* - a[href etc..] or input

*nth-of-type selector* - ul:nth-of-type(3) - only the 3rd of ul changes

Also learnt about Specificity, what CSS does in order to determine the most important selector.

**Thoughts:** Mind is blown, I've learnt so much and it is all making sense. The twitter community is also great as many people are in the same boat.

### Days 12 & 13: 8 & 9 June 2017 

**Today's Progress**:  Spent on the Udemy WebDev course in Intermediate HTML. Learnt how to put together a registration form consisting of Forms, inputs, validations and dropdown/radio buttons. 

**Thoughts:** The hardest part is remembering how to make labels and inputs link together - but I think in time and practice this will improve. My solution was not 100% the same as Colt's - but the majority of the work was correct.

### Day 11: 7 June 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about tables in HTML - made a pokemon table with pics and links without looking at a cheatsheet. 

**Thoughts:** I'm getting there - things are retaining in my brain!

**Link to work:** (On sublime)

### Day 10: 6 June 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the introductory HTML course on Udemy course. Learnt some new shortcuts (cmd & / for easy commenting, and lorem + 'tab' key for lorem ipsum text. Love these little things that make life a littl easier. 

**Thoughts:** Tired, but still perservering - its been 10 days, and I'm loving it!

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 9: 5 June 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started on the intro to HTML on the Udemy WebDev Bootcamp course to regrasp the HTML basics. Listened to CodeNewbie podcast on Paola Mata's journey in going from Admin to WebDev job at Buzzfeed and felt inspired that I could acheive the same. 

**Thoughts:** Good to know that using the bold tag is no longer relevant (using 'strong' is where its at!). And also MDN - a great resource for web dev!

**Link to work:** N/A


### Day 8: 4 June 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished the Tribute Page for Nelson Mandela in Codepen for FCC. I did look at the example code as I got really stuck so I think I need to do a little course in Bootstrap to fully understand what it is and what it does. Managed to work out (after much researching) why my hyperlink to Wikipedia wasnt working - I was missing an equals sign!! Something so small caused the problem! Also started HTML/CSS on Udemy course. 

**Thoughts:** Definitely frustrating but feels so good when you get the problem sorted. Doing this every day definitely helps retain a little bit of knowledge and start to recognise where the problems are.

### Day 7: 3 June 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Different coding focus today - spent the day at Bletchley Park getting inspired by the work by the Codebreakers of WW2 esp Alan Turing. Watched the intro videos to the Udemy Bootcamp. 

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to getting started on the Udemy course. Need to make sure I also focus on finishing the FCC projects. Feeling inspired and in awe of my Bletchley Park visit today, feeling renewed hopefulness I can up my logic and coding game.

### Day 6: 2 June 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Continued on with FCC's tribute page project. Signed up to Udemy's WebDev Bootcamp, downloading course online so can do on the commute!

**Thoughts:** Getting frustrated that I still don't know exactly how things work or how a page is laid out ready to code. Think I might want to recap on the HTML/Bootstrap pages to see if I can gain some more insight. Thinking that if I can get more personal study done, that I won't need to bootcamp in Vancouver so I'll need to work hard over the next 100 days!

### Day 5: 1 June 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started my first FreeCodeCamp project - building a HTML tribute page for Nelson Mandela. A really good way to test what I have learnt - it's amazing how you can be trying to think of what you should and the answer comes back into your head. 

**Thoughts:** Probably want to go back and look at Bootstrap again to see what I need to be doing to make the webpage seem how it should. But its all about trial and error and I'm loving it!

### Day 4: 31 May 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Ending May with alot of reading - in both Getting a Coding Job for Dummies and Coding for Dummies. Also Completed 3 hours of jQuery on freecodecamp. 

**Thoughts:** Started looking at and visualising remote working I would hope to be doing one day as a full qualified coder. Getting really motivated for this next chapter in my life.

### Day 3: 30 May 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished 'Responsive Design with Bootstrap' section in Freecodecamp - started to get challenged to remember things which was good and surprisingly most of it had stuck! jQuery up next - can't wait!

**Thoughts:** I'm starting to retain some of this info - I'm getting better!

### Day 2: 29 May 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started some challenges on FreeCodeCamp's 'Responsive Design with Bootstrap' section. Frustration set in at some point, but once I googled the solution it was fine. The HTML/CSS languages are starting to make sense in my head now. Bedtime reading of Coding for Dummies - to understand how software/coding development plays a huge part in todays society.

**Thoughts:** I'm really enjoying learning how to code and watching things be developed in front of my eyes. Can't wait to continue.

**Link to work:** Last challenge I completed, got me a little stumped I must admit, as I didnt know where to put "form-control" - in the end it was so obvious! [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/style-text-inputs-as-form-controls)


### Day 1: 28 May 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Completed 34 Items in FCC's Front End Developer Curriculum - mainly focusing on HTML, CSS basics. Read the 1st chapter of 'Coding for Dummies'. Connected with the #100daysofcode crew on twitter.

**Thoughts:** I didnt feel motivated today however I perservered and really enjoyed the coding practice today. Learning to build the Catphotoap was very cool to see it done in real time.
