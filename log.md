# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: 31 May 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Ending May with alot of reading - in both Getting a Coding Job for Dummies and Coding for Dummies. Also Completed 3 hours of jQuery on freecodecamp. 

**Thoughts:** Started looking at and visualising remote working I would hope to be doing one day as a full qualified coder. Getting really motivated for this next chapter in my life.

### Day 3: 30 May 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished 'Responsive Design with Bootstrap' section in Freecodecamp - started to get challenged to remember things which was good and surprisingly most of it had stuck! jQuery up next - can't wait!

**Thoughts:** I'm starting to retain some of this info - I'm getting better!

### Day 2: 29 May 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started some challenges on FreeCodeCamp's 'Responsive Design with Bootstrap' section. Frustration set in at some point, but once I googled the solution it was fine. The HTML/CSS languages are starting to make sense in my head now. Bedtime reading of Coding for Dummies - to understand how software/coding development plays a huge part in todays society.

**Thoughts:** I'm really enjoying learning how to code and watching things be developed in front of my eyes. Can't wait to continue.

**Link to work:** Last challenge I completed, got me a little stumped I must admit, as I didnt know where to put "form-control" - in the end it was so obvious! [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/style-text-inputs-as-form-controls)


### Day 1: 28 May 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Completed 34 Items in FCC's Front End Developer Curriculum - mainly focusing on HTML, CSS basics. Read the 1st chapter of 'Coding for Dummies'. Connected with the #100daysofcode crew on twitter.

**Thoughts:** I didnt feel motivated today however I perservered and really enjoyed the coding practice today. Learning to build the Catphotoap was very cool to see it done in real time.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

<!-- **Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

<!--**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

<!--### Day 1: June 27, Monday

<!--**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

<!--**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
