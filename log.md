# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 28 May 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Completed 34 Items in FCC's Front End Developer Curriculum - mainly focusing on HTML, CSS basics. Read the 1st chapter of 'Coding for Dummies'. Connected with the #100daysofcode crew on twitter.

**Thoughts:** I didnt feel motivated today however I perservered and really enjoyed the coding practice today. Learning to build the Catphotoap was very cool to see it done in real time. 

**Link to work:** Last challenge I completed [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-rgb-to-mix-colors)

<!-- **Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

<!--**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
